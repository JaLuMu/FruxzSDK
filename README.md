Hey! Welcome to **FruxzSDK**!<br>
FruxzSDK is the solution for a better programming experience for bukkit plugins.

With FruxzSDK some new and revised features are added to the workflow, saving the developer a lot of time and effort.

FruxzSDK is also optimized for the usage of 1.16 Minecraft-Servers and for the usage of Kotlin (**ALSO JAVA COMPATIBLE!!!**)
